                                      Points to Remember
 
1.For Duplicacy(Problem like coin change) ->We take 1D Array to store the value.
2.If Duplicacy is not allowed(Problem like Subset sum of array) we take 2D Array to store the value.
3.In knapsnack unbounded problem in 1D array(we can solve in both manner combination type or permutaion(value,weight),
means if we take one pair effect at one time or all pair effect at one time it give same result.
